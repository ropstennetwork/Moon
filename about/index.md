<center>The Faucet allows you to quickly get some ETH on the Ropsten testnet to experiment with.</center>

The Ropsten Network works as sort of a playing ground for Ethereum projects before they are in released. It is an exact copy of the main Ethereum network with the same features and capabilities, but completely separate from it. Meaning, transactions and ethers on one network are not seen on the other. 
You can easily switch between these networks using your favorite client. This allows you to perform experiments on the Ethereum technology without risking your real money!
 
## Use the Ropsten ETH to: 
* Test your next smart contract idea,
* Develop your own ETH client,
* Just mess around with fake ether and brag to your buddies how rich you are (wink wink)!

## How it works 
* For any amount of ether you send on the main net, you get x1000 of ether on the test net. For example, for each 0.1 ETH you send, you will get 100 ETH on the Ropsten network.
* You should send your ETH to the address displayed on the main page. If you have MetaMask wallet you can just click the "Send ETH" button. If not, you can follow these instructions for other wallets like MyEtherWallet. 
* You will receive the Ropsten ETH on the same account you sent the MainNet ETH from. Thus, we recommend not send your ether from an exchange, but to use a wallet MetaMask, MyEtherWallet or Mist.
* Once your transaction is submitted and mined, we will send the Ropsten ether automatically. Here is how you can claim it using your wallet.
