Once you have sent the ETH to the address specified on the main page, you will automatically receive the appropriate amount of Ropsten ETH to the same origin address. See the instructions bellow on how you can claim them:

### Using MetaMask
1. If you are using MetaMask wallet, you should make sure you are logged in:
  * Click on the extension icon in your browser, a popup window will appear.
  * If the popup window is asking for a password, type it in and click `Log In`.
2. Once you are logged in into your wallet, switch to the Ropsten Network by clicking the dropdown in the top left of the window, and selecting `Ropsten Test Network`.
3. Thats it! Your Ropsten ETH balance will appear here and you can transact it as you would with normal ETH balance.

### Using MyEtherWallet
1. Head over to <a href="https://www.myetherwallet.com/#send-transaction" target="_blank">MyEtherWallet</a>.
2. Switch to the Ropsten network by selecting it from the dropdown menu on the top right side, eg `Ropsten (myetherapi.com)`
3. Log in to the wallet as you would normally do.
4. Thats it! Your Ropsten ETH balance will appear here and you can trasact it as you would with normal ETH balance.
