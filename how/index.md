<center>The Faucet allows you to quickly get some ETH on the Ropsten testnet to experiment with.</center>

The Ropsten Network is a testing ground for all Ethereum-related projects. It is an exact copy of the main Ethereum network, with completely separate wallet balances and transactions. It is used to test features and ideas before releasing them to the public. You can easily switch between the MainNet and Ropsten Network using just your wallet app like MetaMask or MyEtherWallet.
 
## You can use the ether on Ropsten network to: 
* Test your next smart contract idea,
* Develop your own ETH client,
* Just mess around with fake ether and brag to your buddies how rich you are (wink wink)!

## How it works 
* You send any amount of ETH on the mainnet to the faucet wallet address and get back 1000 times more ETH on the Ropsten network. *For example, for each 0.1 ETH you send, you will get 100 ETH on the Ropsten network.*
* You should send your ETH to the address displayed on the [main page](https://faucet.ropsten.network).
* If you have MetaMask wallet extension enabled, simply clicking the ETH address will invoke the appropriate transaction for you to confirm. 

## How will I get my ETH
* You will receive the Ropsten ETH on the same account you sent the mainnet ETH from. Thus, we recommend *NOT* to send your ether from an exchange, but to use a wallet like MetaMask, MyEtherWallet or Mist. Once your transaction is submitted and mined, we will send the Ropsten ether automatically.
* See [these instructions](https://faucet.ropsten.network/instructions) on how to access and use your Ropsten ETH.
